# Redux - Opinionated

This is a feature branch of `react-universally` that is up to with version `v12.0.0`.

It provides you with an opinionated implementation of Redux, making use of Redux Thunk as a middleware, as well as the React Jobs library to provide a data prefetching technique that works across the server and client. Additionally it merges in the `feature/flow` branch so that we can use Flow types to declare the Redux actions.
